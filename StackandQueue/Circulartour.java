    // Given information about N petrol pumps (say arr[]) that are present in a
    // circular path. The information consists of the distance of the next petrol
    // pump from the current one (in arr[i][1]) and the amount of petrol stored in
    // that petrol pump (in arr[i][0]). Consider a truck with infinite capacity that
    // consumes 1 unit of petrol to travel 1 unit distance. The task is to find the
    // index of the first starting point such that the truck can visit all the
    // petrol pumps and come back to that starting point.

    // Note: Return -1 if no such tour exists.

    // Examples:

    // Input: arr[] = {{4, 6}, {6, 5}, {7, 3}, {4, 5}}.
    // Output: 1
    // Explanation: If started from 1st index then a circular tour can be covered.

    // Input: arr[] {{6, 4}, {3, 6}, {7, 3}}
    // Output: 2
